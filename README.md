# getkey

### Introduction
`getkey.py` is a Python library module that allows the user to read key presses
immediately, as the keys are typed, without the need to press the Enter key.
It provides just one function, getkey(), which blocks until the user presses
a key. This function returns a 2-tuple containing the `bytes` representation of
the key being pressed and a developer-friendly name of the key.
